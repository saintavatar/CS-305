Artemis Financial, a consulting firm specializing in personalized financial planning, sought to modernize its operations while enhancing security for its RESTful web API, which handles sensitive client financial data. My role was to identify vulnerabilities and implement solutions to protect against breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance risks such as GDPR and U.S. financial regulations. This required evaluating threats, strengthening authentication and encryption, and addressing software security flaws.
In assessing the software, I systematically identified vulnerabilities through manual code review and static testing. Several security issues emerged, including hardcoded credentials, missing input validation, lack of authentication on API endpoints, and exposure to outdated dependencies that posed risks. My approach prioritized secure coding, as it plays a crucial role in protecting client data, preventing fraud, and maintaining the company’s reputation and trustworthiness.
The vulnerability assessment process presented both challenges and opportunities for deeper learning. Understanding how different security flaws interconnect was particularly insightful—recognizing how improper input validation could lead to injection attacks or how failing to implement rate limiting could expose the system to denial-of-service (DoS) threats. Implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), AES-256 encryption, and structured error logging helped fortify security measures.
To strengthen Artemis Financial’s security posture, I focused on increasing layers of protection through advanced encryption, implementing proper access controls, and enforcing secure data handling across API endpoints. Moving forward, thorough manual review, automated static testing tools, and dependency checks will remain essential in assessing vulnerabilities and selecting mitigation strategies.
Ensuring the functionality and security of the software required rigorous testing and validation. After refactoring code, I conducted additional security scans and penetration testing to confirm that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Dependency checks and input validation were revisited, reinforcing the integrity of the application.
Throughout the project, various resources and tools proved invaluable, including OWASP Dependency-Check for identifying outdated libraries, structured error logging for debugging, and systematic validation techniques to counter injection threats. These strategies will be instrumental in future security projects.
Looking ahead, this project serves as a strong demonstration of my ability to assess vulnerabilities, enhance application security, and apply cybersecurity best practices in real-world financial technology solutions. Presenting this work to future employers would showcase my expertise in secure development, vulnerability assessment, and risk mitigation strategies within an evolving digital landscape.
